# Movie Ratings Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing movie ratings to uncover trends, insights, and patterns in audience preferences. It is part of the "Python for Machine Learning & Data Science Masterclass" course.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing using `pandas` and `numpy`.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends in movie ratings.
- Visualization of insights using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
- Key findings documented with graphs and explanations.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Data Analysis: `pandas`, `numpy`
  - Data Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
  - Jupyter Notebook for analysis and visualization

## Project Overview

- **Dataset**: The project uses a dataset of movie ratings, including information such as title, genre, ratings, and more.
- **Objective**: To identify trends, insights, and audience preferences from the dataset.
- **Steps Taken**:
  1. Data Cleaning: Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and formatting data.
  2. Data Analysis: Grouping, filtering, and calculating statistical measures to analyze ratings.
  3. Visualization: Creating bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots to present findings.

## Key Insights

- Genres with the highest average ratings.
- Distribution of movie ratings over time.
- Correlation between variables (e.g., runtime and ratings).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
